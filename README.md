# OrderSwap
OrderSwap presents the idea of ​​a new concept in restaurants. Why should a waiter come to take your order when he could bring it directly?
Thus comes the idea of ​​making an application, in which the customer sees a list of products, from which he will be able to choose. At the end of the choices, he will be able to see the total cost of consumption. It is also in favor of the restaurant that both the chef and the waiter will see the order and the place of the order, in order to be able to cook and serve the order properly.
The purpose of the application is to shorten the waiting time in restaurants and to learn the combination of a C++ file and a Python file in creating a project.
